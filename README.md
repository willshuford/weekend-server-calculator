# PROJECT NAME: Weekend Challenge #2: Server Side Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 1 Week Sprint_

For this project, my task was to create a calculator app that demonstrates my understanding of the client/server request/response cycle. To show that the app is making sensible use of the request/response cycle, all mathematical logic needed to be implemented on the server, calculation history data had to be stored on the server, and the client-side code needed to:

 - Ask the server for its calculation history, then render it appropriately on the DOM.
 - Obtain "new calculation" data via user input, then send it to the server.
